<h1>What is this project?</h1>
This project is just a simple movie website, but it is important because it helped me learn more about React, React Rooter, and Tailwind.

Here you can see the front of the page, where I created a slide with some movies these slides have a duration of 5 seconds before they pass to the other.

The concept of this project is basically a website where you can search for any movie that you want and you can save the movie poster.

This project is not complete I want to add more features that I end up not doing, like when you click on the movie poster you can see the plot of the movie.

Here we have the result page when you search for a movie the results will show up I used the OMdb Api to search for the movies.

You can see we have a button every time you hover the mouse on any poster, that's the save button when you click save the movie goes to the saved pages, and you can add how many movies you want.
